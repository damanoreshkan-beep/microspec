# Authoring a microspec app (the agent-driven loop)

There is **no autonomous API generator** — the LLM in the loop is the agent (Claude) working in-session.
The human gives a prompt; the agent authors the app-specific files; deterministic tooling does the rest;
CI is the gate (and it now reviews **both themes**).

## The loop

```
prompt → probe source → author spec.json (ajv-gated) → author data.js|view.js → scaffold → e2e → push → CI green (both themes)
```

1. **Probe the data source first** (never build on an unverified API): check status / CORS / shape with a
   plain `deno eval` fetch. Confirm it returns `ACAO: *` to a browser `Origin` (direct works on a static
   host), or plan the `/feed` fallback. Pick a keyless, CORS-friendly source. (A **tool** app with no
   network — pure math like `sun`/`transit` — skips this.)

2. **Author `spec.json`** — the declarative app *structure only* (theme, tabs, card slots, detail,
   filters). **Translations are NOT inline** — each language is its own file: `apps/<id>/i18n/uk.json`
   and `apps/<id>/i18n/en.json` (flat `{ key: string }` dicts; `en` is the required fallback). index.html
   composes them (`start({ ...spec, i18n })`); the ajv gate composes too, so a missing key still fails.
   Add every new UI string to **all** locale files at once. Families: `list` (feed|row|grid|table) ·
   `converter` · `dashboard` · `tool` · `profile`, plus top-level `detail` and the systemic capabilities
   below. See `packages/schema/SCHEMA.md`.
   **No raw cards (enforced):** a `feed` card must carry a preview slot — at least one of
   `subtitle` / `body` / `image`; a title-only feed card is rejected by the validator. Use `layout:"row"`
   for a compact title+value line, `layout:"grid"` for an icon tile (needs `icon`|`image`), or
   `layout:"table"` for dense columns. If the source has no preview text (e.g. Hacker News), add
   `enrich: { url, body }`; foreign-language text follows the UI locale via `translate: [...]`.
   **Gate it immediately:** `deno run -A packages/schema/validate.mjs apps/<id>/spec.json`.

3. **Author the adapter** — one bespoke piece per app:
   - **data app** → `data.js`: `export async function load(filters) → { items, meta, next }`, using
     `import { viaProxy, isJsonObject } from "/_rt/feed.js"`. Every field a card/detail references must
     exist on each item. **Never format dates here** (no locale → a baked string freezes one language):
     return the raw timestamp; the card `meta`/detail renders it locale-aware with `format` `ago`/`when`/
     `since`. `searchFetch` reads `filters.q`; `paginate` returns a `next` cursor. Missing images: emit a
     deterministic data-URI placeholder so a card is never image-less (see `apps/wiki`).
   - **stream app** → `stream.js` (live WS/SSE rendered as a list).
   - **tool app** → `view.js` (custom Preact view) — see next section.

4. **Scaffold the boilerplate** — never hand-write the shell:
   `deno run -A packages/gen/scaffold.mjs apps/<id>` (index.html + manifest + sw + icon.svg). Mode auto:
   `tool` if `view.js`, `stream` if `stream.js`, else `data`. Provide `brand.json` `{bg,fg}` + `brand.svg`
   (lucide **stroke** paths — the icon wraps them in `fill:none;stroke:fg`). After adding an app, rerun
   `deno run -A deploy/manifest.mjs` → regenerates the launcher list `apps/home/apps.json`.

5. **Author `e2e.spec.mjs`** — `export default [{ name, run(h) }]`. Poll on a *real* content marker, not
   `.card` (the skeleton is also `.card`): `[data-fav]` for data feeds, or the tool's own marker
   (`[data-mark]`, `[data-sun]`, `[data-bearing]`). Test the routing invariant: open every overlay /
   sub-screen and assert `h.back()` closes it (not exits). Note badge/label CSS uppercases text → use `/i`
   regexes.

6. **Pre-flight locally (browser-free) BEFORE pushing** — catches the render class of bugs in ~2s so you
   don't burn a ~1-min CI round-trip on them:
   ```
   deno run -A --import-map=packages/gates/preflight.importmap.json packages/gates/preflight.mjs apps/<id>
   ```
   It mounts spec+view in a linkedom DOM and fails on: a throwing view (undefined var, bad import, V8-only
   syntax), an **unclosed tag** (htm renders the tag name as literal text → corrupt DOM), a **missing i18n
   key** referenced by the view (`T(t,"x")` in a locale that lacks `x`), or a blank render. It does NOT
   replace verify (axe/overflow/shots need Chromium) — run both: preflight first, then push.

7. **Push → CI is the gate** (below). **Check the run-level conclusion**, not streamed per-job output.

## Tool apps — compose the SYSTEMIC runtime, don't rebuild

A `type:"tool"` tab renders the `view.js` export named by its `view` key. Props: `{ S, t, tab, toast,
screen, openScreen, closeScreen }`; read reactive state with `useStore(S.t | S.filters | S.locale)`.
Compose the shared runtime components instead of writing geometry/astronomy from scratch:

- `/_rt/globe.js` — `<Globe onPick marker focus points spin/>`: canvas orthographic Earth, **no WebGL so
  it renders in the headless gate**. Location picker / country explorer.
- `/_rt/astro.js` — `BODIES`, `Planet({body})` (shaded micro-sphere, ring/glow), `skyPositions()` (horizon
  az/alt), `eclipticPositions()` (zodiac longitude), `sunHorizon`, `sunTimes`.
- `/_rt/skydial.js` — `<SkyDial marks radial opacityFor fan rotate rim center overlay/>`: a
  **projection-agnostic** circular wheel. Sun compass feeds az+alt+cardinals; a zodiac chart feeds ecliptic
  lon + a fixed ring + sign glyphs. Conjunctions fan into a radial spoke ordered by value; angle placement
  (sin/cos) never spills horizontally.
- `/_rt/timescale.js` — `<TimeScale value now onChange sunrise sunset anchors/>`: day/night sky-ribbon
  scrubber with hour ticks + clickable time-anchor tiles.

Reference consumers: **`sun`** (horizon compass), **`transit`** (live zodiac wheel), **`globe`**. A tool app
may still declare `spec.filters` to get the systemic filter UI + persisted state (the view reads
`useStore(S.filters)`). **Runtime-internal imports must be RELATIVE** (`./astro.js`), never `/_rt/…`: the
build copies `packages/runtime/*` verbatim; only *app* files get the `/_rt/`→`../_rt/` base-path rewrite.

### Haptics are systemic — do not call them for a tap

The runtime delegates one `pointerdown` listener and answers every tappable element itself
(`hapticFor()` in `/_rt/sensors.js`, unit-tested; wired in `index.js`; checked on every app by `verify`).
**Never write `haptic.tick()` for a tap** — you will double-fire on top of the runtime, and an app where
some controls answer and others don't feels broken in a way nobody can name.

Declare intent on the element instead: `data-haptic="bump"` (destructive — clear/delete/reset),
`data-haptic="off"` (this control fires its own, or must stay silent). Typing and disabled controls are
silent by default. Call `haptic.*` from an app **only for an outcome** the tap cannot predict — a save
rejected, a note changing under a sliding finger — never for the touch itself.

In e2e use **`h.tap()`**, not `h.click()`: `click()` dispatches no pointer events, so anything a finger
triggers is invisible to it.

### Sensor apps — seed the mock, and mark what it renders

`/_rt/sensors.js` gives `haptic · geo · compass · wakeLock` — that is the whole list today; motion/mic/camera
do not exist yet and adding one is a deliberate runtime extension. The reading capabilities feed you finished
answers: `compass.start(cb)` reports **true** north (it watches position and
applies the World Magnetic Model itself — never add declination in an app), `geo.watch` reports the full
spec fix `{lat,lng,accuracy,altitude,altitudeAccuracy,heading,speed,t}` where `accuracy` is a **95%**
radius. For anything measured, `/_rt/geofix.js` averages a stationary series into a vertex and propagates
error into a total — a distance printed without its `±` is not a measurement.

**The gate has no hardware.** Left alone your app renders "locating…" forever, and that empty branch is
what a11y, overflow@384 and watch@200 then measure — so the live layout (a rotated dial's bounding box, the
readout at its widest) is checked by nobody and breaks only on a real phone. This has shipped twice.

So: seed a plausible reading when `isGate || MOCK` (see `apps/ruler` — `SAMPLE_FIXES` is a stationary burst,
`apps/sun` — heading `300`, deliberately rotated), and put **`data-live`** on an element that cannot exist
without a reading. Preflight fails any app importing `geo`/`compass`/`motion`/`mic`/`camera` that mounts no
`[data-live]`. Seed the *widest* state, not the tidiest: the string nobody measures is the one that
overflows.

## Systemic capabilities (declare in the spec — reusable across apps)

Layouts `feed`/`row`/`grid`/`table` · `detail` · `search`/`searchFetch` · `paginate` (infinite scroll) ·
`sort` (persisted segmented control) · `filters` types `select`/`toggle`/`segment`/`range`/`multi`
(persisted) · `stream` (live source) · `detail.actions[].play` (in-app video: wakeLock + PiP + fullscreen + resume, all runtime-owned) · `chart` (SVG heat bars) · table columns
(`heat`/`sub`/`lg`/`muted`/`mono`/`align`/`format`) · `translate` · `enrich` · date `format`
`ago`/`when`/`since`. Add a capability to the schema+runtime once; every app reuses it. See `SCHEMA.md`.

## Quality gate — BOTH themes

CI: `unit` (runtime tests + ajv over every spec) → a Chromium `verify` job per changed app
(packages/ change → whole farm). On **every tab** (not just the default) each verify runs:
**axe 0 critical/serious in DARK *and* LIGHT** · no overflow@384 · glance@200; plus e2e and shots
(`main.png` · `tab-<id>.png` per tab · `light.png`).

- **Accessible names.** Every form control (`input`/`select`/`toggle`) needs an accessible name — an
  `aria-label` (or wrapping `<label>`) — even when the visual design shows no text label. axe `label` /
  `select-name` are *critical* and now fire on any tab.

- **Theme-aware only.** Anything that flips with the theme must be theme-aware **CSS** — a DaisyUI var
  class (`text-base-content`, `bg-base-100`) or `light-dark(darkVal, lightVal)` — **never a colour computed
  in JS at render**, because the view doesn't re-render on the theme toggle (a baked `lighten()`/hex won't
  flip). Rule of thumb: muted `base-content/50` fails light, `/60` borderline, **`/70`+ safe both**. Accent
  tints (heat ink) → `light-dark(#darkAmber, rgba(brightAmber))`.
- **Wide content** (tables, wide diagrams) scrolls inside its own `overflow-x-auto`, never the page.
- **Review the shot like a demanding designer** — download `main.png` **and** `light.png`
  (`gh run download -n shot-<app>`) and judge alignment / rim-hug / balance / legibility in BOTH themes.
  A green gate is necessary, not sufficient.
- **Fail-fast / cost:** a verify run >1 min is a warning — investigate (check "Set up job" for GitHub infra
  first). Don't let a job burn minutes red.

## Why this shape

The agent writes only the **spec** (taste) + the one **adapter/view** (the bespoke fetch or custom
surface). Everything else is commodity the toolkit owns: the render catalog (`packages/runtime`), the
gate (`packages/gates`), the shell (`scaffold`), and the shared components (globe · astro · skydial ·
timescale). Build a new capability once, systemically — then every app, and the next one, gets it for free.
